# ðŸš— GPS Toll-based System Simulation

A web-based simulation tool built with Streamlit and Folium to calculate toll charges based on the GPS route between major cities in Tamil Nadu, India. The application also visualizes the vehicle route, toll zones, and heatmap data on an interactive map.

## âœ¨ Features

- Select vehicle type and source/destination locations
- Calculate toll charges based on:
  - Distance traveled inside toll zones
  - Fixed fee per toll zone
  - Vehicle type (penalty/exemption applied)
- Interactive map with:
  - Start and end markers
  - Route polyline
  - Toll zones overlay
  - Traffic heatmap
